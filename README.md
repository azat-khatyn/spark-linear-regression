## Spark MLlib pipeline for fitting a linear regression 

This repository contains experimenting with data preprocessing and fitting a Linear Regression model using Spark MLlib. 
It also includes using the script as an Airflow DAG with a single task. 

Data used for this exploration comes from the Life Expectancy (WHO) dataset available on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who
